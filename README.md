# Movie Listing API

### Project Overview

The Movie Listing API is a FastAPI-based application that allows users to manage and interact with movie listings. The API provides endpoints for users to list movies, view listed movies, rate them, and add comments. Authentication is secured using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), ensuring that only the user who listed a movie can edit or delete it. 

## Features
